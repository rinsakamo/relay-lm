# RelayLM Project Status

Last reviewed: 2026-07-23 JST

## Purpose and authority

This page owns current implementation status and active caveats. [Project Execution Plan](architecture/project_execution_plan.md) owns MVP boundary, dependency sequencing, and roadmap ordering. Completed-slice detail, historical handoffs, and evidence links live in the [Project Status Reference Map](reference/project-status-reference-map.md).

## Release position

v0.1 readiness is recorded in [v0.1 Release Readiness](release/v0.1-release-readiness.md). The MVP execution lanes and local durable-memory value smoke are complete. Content-bearing comparison artifacts remain local-only under `local/value_smoke/`.

## Current implementation position

```text
RelayLM Core managed route, pre-stream hardening, Stream Unpack, and RelaySLP orchestration: complete for the accepted v0.1 boundary
O1 local scheduler boundary: complete; O2/O3 remain opt-in local operation and are not app-embedded or default-on
RelayMEM Primary path: current production memory/retrieval authority while the Subjective MEM migration remains incomplete
Character Workspace, Analyzer Candidate Governance, and current SOUL Lab management surfaces: complete for their bounded shipped slices

EV-1 Governed Evidence runtime foundation: complete in PR #629; default-off
OVL-1 CTX-OVL participant-private vertical slice: complete in PR #639; default-off and participant-private only
ASM-1 Shared Assessment runtime foundation: complete in PR #636; default-off
SM-1 Subjective MEM create decision/result vertical slice: complete in PR #646; default-off and prepared-only
ST-1 Markdown + operations commit protocol: next registered slice; not started
```

## Contract-aligned implementation migration boundary

**EV-1** provides route-owned current-user and canonical assistant-response Evidence capture, immutable records, authorization state, projections, checkpoints, and a bounded local Evidence store for one private managed-conversation boundary. It does not itself implement overlay materialization, Shared Assessment, Subjective MEM, multi-user Evidence, export, replication, or purge.

**OVL-1** consumes EV-1 for process-local, bounded, rebuildable, non-durable `participant` / `participant_private` RelayCTX working state. Shared-scene, relationship, quarantine, durable memory formation, and RelayATN mutation authority remain unsupported.

**ASM-1** consumes EV-1 directly and provides character-independent Shared Assessment revisions, one logical current selector, formation-time revalidation, and transaction-bound formation receipts. ASM-1 does not itself write Subjective MEM or inject assessments into the normal response path.

**SM-1** consumes one exact current ASM-1 revision and atomically creates one immutable `create` decision plus one revision-1 prepared Subjective MEM result. The result is non-canonical, non-retrievable, and not ordinary runtime memory authority.

**ST-1** is the next consumer boundary. It must verify the prepared bundle, publish byte-exact canonical Markdown, commit the matching durable operations receipt, finalize or retire prepared linkage, and keep Retrieval fail closed until canonical page and receipt agree.

## Current caveats

- EV-1, OVL-1, ASM-1, and SM-1 remain fully default-off.
- OVL-1 supports only `participant` / `participant_private` process-local overlay state.
- SM-1 performs no LLM, translation, embedding, classifier, RelaySOUL, queue, worker, scheduler, normal response-path, Primary MEM, or Retrieval call.
- Primary MEM remains the current ordinary memory and Retrieval authority until ST-1, required lifecycle migration, and hard cutover are accepted.
- O2/O3 remain explicit local process layers, not browser authority, app-embedded services, or new memory mutation authority.
- RelayCTX short-term runtime injection apply remains default-off and dry-run-only by default.
- Open decision debt remains PM-D1 RelaySOUL gate design-freeze relation, PM-D2 legacy intent-artifact closure/absorption, PM-D4 client-history exclusion deployment policy, and PM-D9 multilingual analyzer/proposal policy.

## Immediate dependency-first work

```text
ST-1 Markdown + operations commit protocol                 next registered slice; not started
  -> LC-1 lifecycle migration                              registered; not started
    -> RT-1 Retrieval projection and hard cutover          registered; not started

Parallel decision work:
  PM-D1 RelaySOUL gate design-freeze relation
  PM-D4 client history exclusion default-off deployment decision
  PM-D9 analyzer candidate governance and multilingual schema policy follow-through
  PM-D2 closure or absorption after PM-D6
```

## Not yet implemented

- canonical Subjective MEM Markdown publication and durable ST-1 commit receipt;
- prepared-linkage finalization/recovery and ordinary Subjective MEM Retrieval eligibility;
- Subjective MEM lifecycle migration and Primary MEM hard cutover;
- shared-scene, relationship, and quarantine CTX-OVL partitions;
- full RelayREL relationship Markdown parsing;
- restore/unhide or physical purge;
- Merge / Supersession runtime apply;
- Secondary MEM consolidation;
- RelaySOUL proposal/intervention/rollback slices;
- static SOUL Lab bundle serving;
- media runtime execution;
- ASR and peer communication transport.
