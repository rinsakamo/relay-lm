# Cognitive Turn Contract

## CognitiveInput

Minimal semantic shape:

```json
{
  "identity": {"content": "..."},
  "state_classes": {
    "user.preference": "the user's likes, dislikes, and preferences",
    "relationship.state": "current qualities of the relationship"
  },
  "state": [],
  "context": [
    {
      "content": "...",
      "sources": ["event-id"],
      "actor": "user"
    }
  ],
  "input": {
    "event_id": "019c...",
    "actor": "user",
    "content": "..."
  }
}
```

- `identity` is authoritative stable character identity.
- `state` contains selected accepted Canonical State.
- `context` contains RelayLM-prepared cognitive material, not authority-equivalent raw transcript replay.
- `input` is the current governed Event.
- `state_classes` provides bounded semantic definitions and may be rendered through provider/schema metadata without changing semantics.

## ContextItem provenance

A Context item carries:

```text
content
sources[]
actor? = user | assistant | other future source role
```

For current Working Context, `sources` identifies the RelayLM-owned source Event and `actor` preserves who authored that Event.

The actor/source metadata is semantically important:

- user-authored Context can support what the user actually said, subject to temporal and semantic scope;
- assistant-authored Context may support dialogue continuity, reference resolution, and unfinished conversational structure;
- assistant-authored Context does not independently establish user facts, preferences, goals, experiences, or external truth;
- inclusion in Context never upgrades the authority of the underlying source.

Context compilation is read/select/project only. `ContextItem` is not a memory mutation or State acceptance mechanism.

## Working Context

The current runtime may include bounded RelayLM-owned recent dialogue in `context`.

This Working Context is intentionally different from durable memory:

```text
Event / State / MEMORY
    durable semantic sources

Working Context
    temporary cognitive residency for conversational continuity
```

Material can leave Working Context under budget pressure while remaining durably available in its source layer. Later retrieval may re-admit it.

The current implementation preserves normal prior `user → assistant` exchanges atomically so budget pressure cannot retain an assistant assertion while dropping the user Event that gave the exchange its conversational basis.

## CognitiveOutput

```json
{
  "response": "...",
  "state_candidates": []
}
```

`response` is user-visible natural language. `state_candidates` are non-authoritative proposals.

The return path is deliberately symmetric with the input path:

```text
CognitiveOutput
  ├─ response
  │    ↓
  │  Assistant Event
  │    ↓
  │  possible future Working Context
  │
  └─ StateCandidate[]
       ↓
     Validator
       ↓
     Canonical State
```

An assistant response therefore remains useful for future conversational continuity without becoming self-certified factual authority.

An ordinary turn targets exactly one cognitive generation. Working Context selection, deterministic validation, persistence, and Context compilation do not add a second ordinary cognitive LLM call.
